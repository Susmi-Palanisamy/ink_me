        <div class="hide"><h3>Tattoos are meant to be permanent and with proper care, they'll stay vibrant for years.
            Initially, some fading or softening of lines may occur, but it's part of the healing process. However, some factors like Sun exposure, skin aging, and lifestyle factors can cause gradual fading so wear sunscreen, and avoid excessive sun exposure to preserve its brilliance. 
            But don't worry, our skilled artists use high-quality inks and techniques to ensure longevity. Additionally, following our aftercare instructions diligently will help maintain your tattoo's integrity. A touch-up session in the future can also revive colors if needed.
